Driver Drowsiness detection
This study proposes a CNN and LSTM based driver drowsiness detection system integrating eye state and yawning recognition.
Employing a drowsiness dataset which consist four classes: open ,closed, yawn, no_yawn ,  for training and evaluation. 
The proposed scheme will use MediaPipe method for the extraction of eye and mouth regions. 
After identifying regions of eye and mouth, this scheme will analyse three deep learning models such as InceptionV3 , ResNet50V2 and LSTM.
The proposed system achieves an impressive accuracy  in binary classification, distinguishing between drowsy and non-drowsy states.
